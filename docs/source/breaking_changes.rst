case you are upgrading an existing site from an older version. For a complete

Django Settings
===============

The following Django settings have changed.

Remote Site Setup
-----------------

For specifying the role of your site in remote project metadata synchronization,
you will need to add two new settings to your Django site configuration:

The ``PROJECTROLES_SITE_MODE`` setting sets the role of your site in remote
project sync and it is **mandatory**. Accepted values are ``SOURCE`` and
``TARGET``. For deployment, it is recommended to fetch this setting from
environment variables.

If your site is set in ``TARGET`` mode, the boolean setting
``PROJECTROLES_TARGET_CREATE`` must also be included to control whether
creation of local projects is allowed. If your site is in ``SOURCE`` mode, this
setting can be included but will have no effect.

Furthermore, if your site is in ``TARGET`` mode you must include the
``PROJECTROLES_ADMIN_OWNER`` setting, which must point to an existing local
superuser account on your site.

Example for a ``SOURCE`` site:

.. code-block:: python

    # Projectroles app settings
    PROJECTROLES_SITE_MODE = env.str('PROJECTROLES_SITE_MODE', 'SOURCE')

Example for a ``TARGET`` site:

.. code-block:: python

    # Projectroles app settings
    PROJECTROLES_SITE_MODE = env.str('PROJECTROLES_SITE_MODE', 'TARGET')
    PROJECTROLES_TARGET_CREATE = env.bool('PROJECTROLES_TARGET_CREATE', True)
    PROJECTROLES_ADMIN_OWNER = env.str('PROJECTROLES_ADMIN_OWNER', 'admin')

General API Settings
--------------------

Add the following lines to your configuration to enable the general API
settings:

.. code-block:: python

    SODAR_API_DEFAULT_VERSION = '0.1'
    SODAR_API_MEDIA_TYPE = 'application/vnd.bihealth.sodar+json'


DataTables Includes
===================

Includes for the DataTables Javascript library are no longer included in
templates by default. If you want to use DataTables, include the required CSS
and Javascript in relevant templates. See the ``projectroles/search.html``
template for an example.

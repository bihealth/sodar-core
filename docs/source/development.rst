Development
^^^^^^^^^^^

This section contains instructions and guidelines for developing apps for your
SODAR Core based site, as well as contributing to the development of the SODAR
Core package itself.

We first describe the process of developing *project apps*, which are the most
common type of app on SODAR Core based sites. In the following pages we discuss
*site apps* and *backend apps*, followed by general guidelines and resources for
development. Finally, guidelines for contributing to the SODAR Core framework
itself are detailed.

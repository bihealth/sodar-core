Site Development
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This section contains instructions and guidelines for developing apps for your
SODAR Core based site.

We first describe the process of developing
:ref:`project apps <dev_project_app>`, which are the most common type of app on
SODAR Core based sites. In the following pages we discuss
:ref:`site apps <dev_site_app>` and :ref:`backend apps <dev_backend_app>`,
followed by general :ref:`resources <dev_resource>` and
:ref:`guidelines <dev_guideline>` for development.

For development of the SODAR Core package itself, see :ref:`contributing` and
:ref:`dev_core_overview`.

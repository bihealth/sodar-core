Adminalerts App
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``adminalerts`` site app enables system administrators to display site-wide
messages to all users with an expiration date.


Basics
======

The app displays un-dismissible small alerts on the top of page content to all
users. They can be used to e.g. warn users of upcoming downtime or highlight
recently deployed changes.

Upon creation, an expiration date is set for each alert. Alerts can also be
freely enabled, disabled or deleted by superuser on the app UI. Additional
information regarding an alert can be provided with Markdown syntax and viewed
on a separate details page.

Usage
=====

When logged in as a superuser, you can find the :guilabel:`Admin Alerts` option
in your user dropdown menu in the top right corner of the site. This application
is only available for users with superuser status.

The initial view displays a list of alerts along with their active/inactive
status. For each alert there is a dropdown for updating or deleting the alert.
The :guilabel:`Status` column active/inactive badge doubles as a button for
toggling the alert status. Inactive alerts will not be shown to users.

    Admin alert list

To create a new alert, click the :guilabel:`Create Alert` button. This presents
a simple form for creating a new alert. The following fields can be edited:

Message
    The message displayed to users on any page of the site.
Expiry Date
    The date when this alert will automatically expire and no longer be
    displayed.
Active
    Flag for the current state of the alert. Alerts can be activated or
    inactivated at any time, although activating an expired alert will not cause
    it to be displayed to users.
Require Auth
    If set true, this alert will only be shown to users logged in to the site.
    If false, it will also appear in the login screen as well as for anonymous
    users if allowed on the site.
Send Alert as Email
    Send alert as email to all users with email notifications enabled, with the
    exception of the sender. This is enabled by default when creating an alert.
    When updating an existing alert it is initially disabled to avoid redundant
    emails when e.g. fixing a typo.
Description
    A longer description, which can be accessed through the :guilabel:`Details`
    link in the alert element. Markdown syntax is supported.

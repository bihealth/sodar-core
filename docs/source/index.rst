Welcome to the SODAR Core documentation!
========================================

This documentation provides instructions and guidelines for integration, usage
and development of SODAR Projectroles Django app as well as other reusable core
SODAR-based apps.

SODAR (System for Omics Data Access and Retrieval) is a specialized project for
managing data in omics research projects.

This repository contains the core reusable and non-domain-specific apps of the
system. These apps can be used for any application which requires project-based
access and dynamic app management on a Django web site.
